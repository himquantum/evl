# I wanted to let you know that I’ve decided to move on from my role at [Companyevl

I hope you are doing well. I wanted to let you know that I’ve decided to move on from my role at U.S. Bank with my last working day being Oct 31.

This wasn’t an easy decision, but after careful thought, I’ve decided to move forward in a direction that aligns with my personal and professional goals. I am grateful for the opportunities I’ve had here and for your guidance and support during my time with the CDA team.

I’ll do my best to ensure a smooth transition , including wrapping up ongoing tasks and helping with any knowledge transfer before my departure. Please let me know how I can assist in this process.

Thank you again for everything.
